### DunedinPACE now works on EPICv2! 

Follow instructions and formatting as for EPICv1 or 450k (below). The function will detect EPICv2 data (if replicate suffixes are retained in the rownames) and will lower the `proportionOfProbesRequired = 0.8` to `0.7` as EPICv2 is already missing some probes that were originally in 450k and EPICv1. More evidence supporting DunedinPACE in EPICv2 can be in Karen Sugden's [excellent report](https://moffittcaspi.trinity.duke.edu/dunedinpace/validation-dunedinpace-epic-v2-data). 

### DunedinPACE website is online
A new [website with information on DunedinPACE](https://moffittcaspi.trinity.duke.edu/dunedinpace), hosted by Avshalom Caspi and Terrie Moffitt's lab is is now live. There you can find additional information about DunedinPACE, cohorts and studies where it has been deployed, some of the key findings, and interesting advancements and news related to the DunedinPACE tool. 

# Introduction to DunedinPACE
DunedinPACE is a first of its kind blood DNA methylation biomarker of the pace of biological aging. It is designed to function as a speedometer for the aging process, estimating their pace of aging from a single blood sample. DunedinPACE values quantify how much faster or slower an individual is aging relative to the normative rate of one year of aging per year of calendar time.

#### How was DunedinPACE developed? 
DunedinPACE was developed to predict a [Pace of Aging phenotype](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1506264112) in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study. The [version of the Pace of Aging used to train DunedinPACE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00044-4) was a composite of rates of change in 19 biomarkers of organ system integrity measured over four time points spanning 20 years of follow-up as the cohort aged from 26 to 45. 

#### What is the evidence for using DunedinPACE to measure aging? 
There are three lines of evidence that support the validity of DunedinPACE: First, DunedinPACE is predictive of diverse aging related outcomes, including disease, disability, and mortality[^1],[^2],[^3],[^4],[^5]. Second, DunedinPACE is associated with social determinants of healthy aging in young, midlife, and older adults[^1],[^6],[^7],[^8],[^9],[^10]. Third, Dunedin PACE shows evidence of being modified by calorie restriction[^11], an intervention that modifies the basic biology of aging in animal experiments[^12].  

#### What do I need to run DunedinPACE? 
To run the package, you need DNA methylation data produced by the Illumina 450k, EPIC, or EPIC V2 arrays. The data should consist of a matrix of beta values (percent methylation at the CpG site) and must be formatted as follows: rows are individual probes; columns are samples; rownames are Illumina CpG probe names (i.e. cg###########). Although `DunedinPACE` reflects 'pace of aging', it is computed from a single measure DNA methylation data. 

Once you have downloaded and installed the package, you simply load `DunedinPACE` library, load the beta matrix of your date into R and run the `PACEProjector()` function on the matrix. The output will be a vector of `DunedinPACE` values matched to sample IDs. 

The easiest way to implement DunedinPACE is load the full beta matrix with all available CpGs (i.e. the whole genome). However, if you wish to work with a smaller data object, you can select the needed CpG sites from your data using the function `getrequired probes()` with the `backgroundList` argument set to “TRUE” `(backgroundList = TRUE)`.  This will return a matrix of 20,000 probes, including the `DunedinPACE` probes and a set of probes used for background normalization that ensure the computed values can be compared to the reference value of 1 year of biological aging per calendar year. (The default setting is `backgroundList = FALSE`, but will return only the 173 probes used to calculate `DunedinPACE`, but not the probes required for normalization).  

#### What values should I expect the package to return? 
A “normal” `DunedinPACE` value for a midlife adult is 1.0. Younger people tend to have somewhat slower DunedinPACE values and older people tend to have somewhat faster DunedinPACE values (see Panel A from Figure below):

# The DunedinPACE R package
The DunedinPACE R package allows users to calculate DunedinPACE in their own DNA methylation dataset. Given a set of methylation beta values, where rows are probes and columns are subjects, this tool will produce DunedinPACE. All columns should correspond to Rownames should correspond to Illumina CpG probe names.


#### Installation (via devtools):
To install the DunedinPACE and associated vignette, please use the following code:
```r
devtools::install_github("danbelsky/DunedinPACE", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
To view the associated vignette, load the `DunedinPACE` package and use the following:
```r
library(DunedinPACE)
vignette("DunedinPACE")
```

### PACEProjector()

#### Usage:
The primary function in the `DundedinPACE` package is the `PACEProjector()` function. The `PACEProjector()` function calculates DunedinPACE for the provided dataset. 
We recommend loading a beta matrix containing *all available* CpGs, but options for working with a subset of the full 450k or EPIC array datasets are provided below.

```r
# load the DunedinPACE package
library("DunedinPACE")

# Apply function to matrix of beta values (here called 'betas'). 
PACEProjector(betas)
```
#### Input:

#####  betas:
    Matrix or data.frame of beta values where rownames are probe ids and column names should correspond to sample names.
    Ensure beta values are numeric and that missing values should be coded as 'NA'

#####  proportionOfProbesRequired:
    This is the proportion of probes required to have a non-missing value for both the sample to have
    DunedinPACE calculated, as well as to determine if we can impute the mean from the current cohort.
    By default, this is set to 0.7

#### Output:
   A vector of DunedinPACE estimates.      

***

### getRequiredProbes()

#### Usage:
To see the CpG probes required by the `DunedinPACE` package.
```r
getRequiredProbes()
```

#### Input:
No input required.

#### Output
`getRequiredProbes(backgroundList = FALSE)` returns 173 probes used for calculating DunedinPACE directly. 
`getRequiredProbes(backgroundList = TRUE)` returns 173 probes used for calculating DunedinPACE directly, as well as 19827 probes used in the normalization process. 

We do not recommend excluding the 19827 probes used for normalization and calculating DunedinPACE using only the 173 DunedinPACE associated probes, as this will affect DunedinPACE estimates.
